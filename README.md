## NY_Restaurant_Inspection_Analysis


## Introduction

Since July 2010, the Health Department has required restaurants to implement letter grading showing the sanitary inspection results. The Health Department inspects about 24,000 restaurants a year to monitor compliance with City and State food safety regulations. This dataset is called New York Restaurant Inspection Result which contains the detailed information of each restaurant inspected like name, location, phone number and the result of each inspection including score, grade, violation description and so on. We found this dataset from NYC OpenData website and we would like to look into the dataset and to find some patterns with its geographic data, and times series data, etc.
